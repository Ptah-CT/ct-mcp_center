 âš  You are using a non-standard "NODE_ENV" value in your environment. This creates inconsistencies in the project and is strongly advised against. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/non-standard-node-env
 âš  Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /home/auctor/pnpm-lock.yaml as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /home/auctor/srv/ct-mcp_center/pnpm-lock.yaml
